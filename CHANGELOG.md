## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`install.sh` step 3.5 — vault-template seeding.** Fresh `--apply` runs now copy `vault-template/` into the target vault when the 7-folder layout is absent, including three placeholder projects (`example-project-1/2/3`) and a seed `Projects-Index.md` so `/tether` has something to audit on day one.
- **`/import-claude` and `/import-notes` skills** — brought the shipped skill count to 12. `/import-claude` routes a Claude.ai Project export (conversations + knowledge + assets) into the matching `05-Projects/<PROJECT>/` subtree; `/import-notes` handles the more general "pile of files from somewhere else" case.
- **FidgetFlo attribution in README** — the self-learning intelligence tier is sourced from FidgetFlo (a fork of ruvnet/ruflo@v3.5.80) and now credited as such.
- **NicholasSpisak repo link** — added to the origin story and Credits.

### Fixed
- **launchd plist PATH + flags.** The four `scheduled/launchd/*.plist` templates had (a) stale `--headless --audit` flags on the agent invocations, removed, and (b) a PATH that didn't always include Homebrew's `/opt/homebrew/bin` on Apple Silicon, patched at install time.
- **Nathan → Nate sweep.** Purged every "Nathan" / "Nathan Davidovich" reference from shipped skill MDs, commands, README, and migration docs. Canonical is Nate Davidovich / Lorecraft LLC.
- **Ruvnet/claude-flow/ruflo attribution.** Removed the inaccurate direct-descent claim from README in favor of the actual lineage (FidgetFlo fork).
- **15-agent audit-and-fix pass** — this release. Full consistency sweep across `README.md`, `PHILOSOPHY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/**`, `references/wiki-schema.md`, and every `skills/*/SKILL.md` to close the residual drift between prose and shipped behavior after v0.1.4.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-04-17

### Added — `install.sh` now applies the CLAUDE.md patch (closes v0.1.3 known gap)

Previously `docs/CLAUDE-MD-PATCH.md` was the canonical post-mogging contract that was supposed to be appended to every user vault's `CLAUDE.md` at install time, but the installer didn't actually consume it — the file was documentation-only. New users who ran `install.sh --apply` got skills, agents, and launchd plists wired up, but their vault's `CLAUDE.md` still described whatever layout they had before install. This closes that gap.

- **New install step: `apply_claude_md_patch` (step 9.5)** — runs between `link_claude_memory` and `install_launchd` in the main install sequence. Extracts the canonical block (between `<!-- 2ndbrain-mogging:start -->` and `<!-- 2ndbrain-mogging:end -->` markers) from `docs/CLAUDE-MD-PATCH.md` and writes it to `$VAULT/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Idempotent** — re-running `install.sh --apply` detects existing markers and replaces the block between them, never duplicating.
- **Legacy migration** — vaults that have the pre-namespaced `<!-- mogging:start -->` / `<!-- mogging:end -->` marker pair from older installs get their legacy block stripped and replaced with the new namespaced block. No manual migration required.
- **Backup-before-mutation** (non-negotiable #1 enforced) — the existing vault `CLAUDE.md` is copied to `$VAULT/Claude-Memory/backups/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/CLAUDE.md.bak` before any write.
- **Fresh vaults handled** — if the vault has no `CLAUDE.md`, a minimal header is created and the patch is appended below it.
- **Honors `--dry-run`** — logs the intended patch in dry-run mode; only writes on `--apply`.
- **New exit code 41** — reserved for patch extraction failures (missing markers in source file).

No behavior change for users who don't re-run the installer. Next `install.sh --apply` on any existing install will migrate the CLAUDE.md block to the current canonical contract.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed — post-mogging contract sync across skills, docs, schema

15-agent /fswarmmax fix swarm addressed all known pre-mogging folder drift in skill runtime paths, README tables, migration docs, and the CLAUDE-MD-PATCH template that gets appended to user vaults at install. Before this release, the plugin documented the post-mogging 7-folder layout in prose while still carrying pre-mogging destinations (`07-Projects/`, `08-Tasks/`, `02-Literature/`, `03-Permanent/`, `00-Inbox/`, `01-Fleeting/`, `06-Assets/`) throughout skill specs — meaning `/save`, `/wiki`, `/challenge`, `/emerge`, and siblings could route writes to folders the contract had already retired.

- **`skills/{aliases,autoresearch,backfill,canvas,challenge,connect,emerge,save,wiki}/SKILL.md` + `references/wiki-schema.md`:** 31 of 49 pre-mogging folder references updated to post-mogging targets (historical prose preserved where it describes the rename itself). Every runtime destination, routing rule, and example path now resolves against `01-Conversations/` / `02-Sources/` / `03-Concepts/` / `04-Index/` / `05-Projects/` / `06-Tasks/` / `Claude-Memory/`.
- **`docs/CLAUDE-MD-PATCH.md`:** full rewrite (147 → 192 lines). This is the file appended to user vaults' CLAUDE.md at install time — previous versions installed stale pre-mogging contract into new vaults. Marker block renamed from `<!-- mogging:* -->` to `<!-- 2ndbrain-mogging:* -->` for namespace clarity. Now carries the canonical 7-folder table, killed-folders callout, grandfathered-type mapping (literature→source, permanent→concept, moc→index, fleeting→inbox-residue), 10 skills list, 4 scheduled agents with correct times (morning 8am, nightly 10pm, weekly Fri 6pm, health Sun 9pm), 3 non-negotiables, bot-prefix commits table, and 9 hard rules.
- **`README.md`:** regime-ownership table updated (HUMAN → `03-Concepts/`, PROJECT → `05-Projects/` + `06-Tasks/`, LLM-COMPILED → `03-Concepts/wiki-*.md`). Scheduled-agents table fully rewritten to match shipped plists + agent-spec write paths (`01-Conversations/VAULT/reports/*`). Backward-compat claim about killed folders inverted — `aliases.yaml` remaps entity names only, not folder structures.
- **`MIGRATION.md`:** folder-numbering callout rewritten to the post-mogging 7-folder scheme with pointer to `docs/MIGRATION.md` for pre-mogging → post-mogging migration runbook. `/aliases init` walk target corrected `07-Projects/` → `05-Projects/`.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`:** test harness path typo `tests/run-all.sh` → `tests/run_all.sh` (actual filename uses underscore).

### Changed — regex hardening for PII scrub

- **`.filter-repo-replacements.example.txt`:** added explicit WARNING section documenting the v0.1.1 substring-bleed regression mode. Future forks get a prominent callout: `regex:\bNAME\b` word-boundary patterns are NOT safe with all `git-filter-repo` versions — use capitalized literal rules instead. Documents the exact corruption signature (`security` → `sec<person-i>ty`, etc.) so the mistake cannot be innocently reintroduced.

### Known gaps (v0.1.3)

- `install.sh` does not currently consume `docs/CLAUDE-MD-PATCH.md` — the file is a reference template not yet wired into the live installer. Wiring the append step is tracked as a follow-up.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Critical: reverted substring corruption from v0.1.1 PII scrub.** The `regex:\buri\b==><person-i>` rule in `.filter-repo-replacements.txt` did not honor its word-boundary `\b` anchors, so `git-filter-repo` replaced `uri` as a literal substring in 39+ English words across 19 files. `security` became `sec<person-i>ty`, `during` became `d<person-i>ng`, `heuristics` became `he<person-i>stics`, `buried` became `b<person-i>ed`, `configuring` became `config<person-i>ng`, `gesturing` became `gest<person-i>ng`. Same bug with `\balan\b` corrupted `balance` → `b<person-c>ce`. All reverted across `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `references/wiki-schema.md`, `scripts/prepublish-check.sh`, `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml`, 5 skill files, 2 vault-template files, 2 PII-config examples, and more.
- **Critical: `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml:76` now correctly references `trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main`** (was `trufflesec<person-i>ty/trufflehog@main` → GitHub Actions failed to resolve the action on every push).
- **Prepublish gate restored.** `scripts/prepublish-check.sh` now prints `"security-gate files present"` instead of `"sec<person-i>ty-gate files present"`.
- **Placeholder preservation:** legitimate mapping rule `regex:\buri\b==><person-i>` in `.filter-repo-replacements.txt` left intact (that's the config, not the corrupted output). A future history rewrite needs a git-filter-repo version that honors regex-prefix word-boundaries, or a different replacement strategy (e.g., `--replace-message` pattern).

### Changed
- Scrubbed residual "auto-delete" / "auto-remove" / "silently delete|remove|overwrite|misfile" phrasing from `skills/wiki/SKILL.md`, `skills/save/SKILL.md`, and `references/wiki-schema.md` — replaced with "flag for human review" / "never remove without explicit human approval" language. Behavior unchanged; pure phrasing cleanup to remove alarming verbs from instruction manuals. Guardrail uses of "silent" (e.g., "never silently rewritten", "cannot be silently undone") preserved — they forbid silent behavior rather than promise it.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- PII scrub: redacted all personal and private project names from skill files; replaced with stable `<PERSON-X>` / `<PROJECT-X>` placeholders (see [`docs/placeholder-names.md`](docs/placeholder-names.md)).
- `install.sh` idempotency: re-running with an existing `2ndbrain` Stop hook now skips the `jq` merge instead of appending a duplicate entry.
- `install.sh`: inline Stop-hook overlay referenced `hooks/stop-hook.sh`; corrected to `hooks/stop-save.sh` (matches the shipped filename).
- Eliminated hardcoded user-home paths from `install.sh` and the 4 `scheduled/launchd/*.plist` templates — `install.sh` now substitutes `$HOME` at install time.
- `skills/emerge/SKILL.md`: added missing `allowed-tools:` frontmatter field.
- `skills/wiki/SKILL.md`: removed stale `/cingest + /clint` reference from the skill description.
- README vault-structure diagram: updated from the legacy 9-folder layout to the post-mogging 7-folder contract.
- `docs/MIGRATION.md`: created — root `MIGRATION.md` referenced it three times but the file was missing.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: expanded v0.1.0 entry with the full feature list.

### Security
- Full git history rewrite via `git-filter-repo` to remove PII from all past commits (not just `HEAD`).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-16 — Initial release

### Added

**Skills (10, auto-namespaced under `2ndbrain-mogging`)**

- `challenge` — adversarial agent that argues against an idea using the user's own prior notes
- `emerge` — pattern-miner across recent vault activity; surfaces rising topics and killed ideas
- `backfill` — scrape historical Claude Code JSONL session transcripts into the vault
- `aliases` — bootstrap and maintain `Claude-Memory/aliases.yaml` entity→project dictionary
- `autoresearch` — three-round web research loop with gap-filling and source reconciliation
- `canvas` — generate and maintain Obsidian Canvas files from vault queries

- `bin/backup-vault.sh` — tarball backup to `~/Desktop/2ndBrain-backup-*.tar.gz`.

**Vault contract**
- Post-mogging 7-folder layout: `01-Conversations/`, `02-Sources/`, `03-Concepts/`, `04-Index/`, `05-Projects/`, `06-Tasks/`, `Claude-Memory/` (symlink).
- Six root sidecars: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CRITICAL_FACTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`.
- Four-regime architecture: HUMAN / PROJECT / SYNC / LLM-COMPILED.
- `[bot:*]` commit-prefix convention to suppress n8n re-ingest on automated writes.

**Security**
- `.gitleaks.toml` with custom rules for morgen-api, n8n-api, private email, and private client names.
- `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` running gitleaks + trufflehog on every push.
- `config/nathan.pii` and `config/secrets.patterns` as the canonical PII/secret lists.
- `scripts/prepublish-check.sh` — fail-closed prepublish gate.

**Repository scaffold**
- `vault-template/` for fresh vault onboarding.
- `.claude-plugin/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `scheduled/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, `bin/`, `references/` folders.
- MIT license.
- `.gitignore` covering macOS `.DS_Store`, Node artifacts, env files, test-vault Claude memory, install-script signature files.

- `docs/CREDITS.md` — attribution to 5 upstream sources + 3 secondary.
- `docs/SECURITY.md` — gitleaks config, `install.sh` trust boundary (minisign + SHA-256 + pinned public key).
- `docs/foundations/01-05` — per-source analysis documents.
- `docs/placeholder-names.md` — public-facing explainer of the `<PERSON-X>` / `<PROJECT-X>` redaction convention.

**Tests**
- 7 `tests/test_*.sh` scripts plus `tests/lib/assertions.sh` — harness covering install, uninstall, skills, migration, idempotency, Stop-hook merge, and launchd plists.
